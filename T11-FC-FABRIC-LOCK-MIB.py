A Fibre Channel Fabric lock is used to\nensure serialized access to some types of management data\nrelated to a Fabric, e.g., the Fabric's Zoning Database.\n\nSome (managing) applications generate Fabric locks by\ninitiating server sessions.  Server sessions are\ndefined generically in FC-GS-5 to represent a collection of\none or more requests to the session's server, e.g., to the\nZone Server.  Such a session is started by a Server Session\nBegin (SSB) request, and terminated by a Server Session End\n(SSE) request.  The switch receiving the SSB is called the\n'managing' switch.  Some applications require the\n'managing' switch to lock the Fabric for the particular\napplication, e.g., for Enhanced Zoning, before it can\nrespond successfully to the SSB.  On receipt of the\nsubsequent SSE, the lock is released.  For this usage, the\nmanaging switch sends an Acquire Change Authorization (ACA)\nrequest to other switches to lock the Fabric.\n\nFor some other applications, a managing switch locks the\nFabric using an Enhanced Acquire Change Authorization (EACA)\nrequest, which identifies the application on whose behalf\nthe Fabric is being locked with an Application_ID.\n\nFabric locks can also be requested more directly, e.g.,\nthrough the use of this MIB.  In these situations, the term\n'managing' switch is used to indicate the switch that\nreceives such a request and executes it by issuing either\nACA or EACA requests to other switches in the Fabric.\n\nThis MIB module defines information about the 'managing'\nswitch for currently-active Fabric locks.\n\nCopyright (C) The IETF Trust (2007).  This version\nof this MIB module is part of RFC 4936;  see the RFC\nitself for full legal notices.")

The 'managing switch' is identified by\nvalues of fcmInstanceIndex and fcmSwitchIndex.\n\nServer sessions for several different types of servers\nare defined in FC-GS-5.  The behavior of a server with\n\n\n\nrespect to commands received within a server session is\nspecified for each type of server.  For some types,\nparameter changes can only be made within the context of a\nsession, and the setting up of a session requires that the\nFabric be locked.  A Fabric is locked by one switch, called\nthe 'managing' switch, sending Acquire Change Authorization\n(ACA) requests to all other switches in the Fabric.\n\nFor other applications, a Fabric lock is established by the\n'managing' switch sending Enhanced Acquire Change\nAuthorization (EACA) requests to other switches in the\nFabric.  Each EACA request includes an Application_ID\nvalue to identify the application requesting the lock.\n\nFor the benefit of this MIB module, a distinct value of\nApplication_ID has also been assigned/reserved (see\nANSI INCITS T11/06-679v0, titled 'FC-SW-5 Letter to\nT11.5') as a means of distinguishing locks established via\nAcquire Change Authorization (ACA) requests.  This\nadditional assignment allows an Application_ID to be used to\nuniquely identify any active lock amongst all those\nestablished by either an EACA or an ACA.\n\nWhenever a Fabric is locked, by the sending of either an ACA\nor an EACA, a row gets created in the representation of this\ntable for the 'managing' switch.\n\nIn order to process SNMP SetRequests that make parameter\nchanges for the relevant types of servers (e.g., to the\nZoning Database), the SNMP agent must get serialized access\nto the Fabric (for the relevant type of management data),\ni.e., the Fabric must be locked by creating an entry in\nthis table via an SNMP SetRequest.  Creating an entry in\nthis table via an SNMP SetRequest causes an ACA or an EACA\nto be sent to all other switches in the Fabric.  The value\nof t11FLockApplicationID for such an entry determines\nwhether an ACA or an EACA is sent.\n\nIf an entry in this table is created by an SNMP SetRequest,\nthe value of the t11FLockInitiatorType object in that entry\nwill normally be 'snmp'.  A row for which the value of\nt11FLockInitiatorType is not 'snmp' cannot be modified\nvia SNMP.  In particular, it cannot be deleted via\nt11FLockRowStatus.  Note that it's possible for a row to be\ncreated by an SNMP SetRequest, but for the setup of the lock\nto fail, and immediately thereafter be replaced by a lock\nsuccessfully set up by some other means; in such a case, the\nvalue of t11FLockInitiatorType would change as and when the\n\n\n\nlock was set up by the other means, and so the row could\nnot thereafter be deleted via t11FLockRowStatus.\n\nFC-GS-5 mentions various error situations in which a\nFabric lock is released so as to avoid a deadlock.  In\nsuch situations, the agent removes the corresponding row\nin this table as and when the lock is released.  This can\nhappen for all values of t11FLockInitiatorType.")
