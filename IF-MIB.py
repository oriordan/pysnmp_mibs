It defines\nobjects which allow a network manager to instruct an agent\nto test an interface for various faults.  Tests for an\ninterface are defined in the media-specific MIB for that\ninterface.  After invoking a test, the object ifTestResult\ncan be read to determine the outcome.  If an agent can not\nperform the test, ifTestResult is set to so indicate.  The\nobject ifTestCode can be used to provide further test-\nspecific or interface-specific (or even enterprise-specific)\ninformation concerning the outcome of the test.  Only one\ntest can be in progress on each interface at any one time.\nIf one test is in progress when another test is invoked, the\nsecond test is rejected.  Some agents may reject a test when\na prior test is active on another interface.\n\nBefore starting a test, a manager-station must first obtain\n'ownership' of the entry in the ifTestTable for the\ninterface to be tested.  This is accomplished with the\nifTestId and ifTestStatus objects as follows:\n\ntry_again:\n  get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)\n  while (ifTestStatus != notInUse)\n      /*\n       * Loop while a test is running or some other\n       * manager is configuring a test.\n       */\n      short delay\n      get (ifTestId, ifTestStatus)\n  }\n\n  /*\n   * Is not being used right now -- let's compete\n   * to see who gets it.\n   */\n  lock_value = ifTestId\n\n  if ( set(ifTestId = lock_value, ifTestStatus = inUse,\n           ifTestOwner = 'my-IP-address') == FAILURE)\n      /*\n       * Another manager got the ifTestEntry -- go\n       * try again\n       */\n      goto try_again;\n\n  /*\n   * I have the lock\n   */\n  set up any test parameters.\n\n  /*\n   * This starts the test\n   */\n  set(ifTestType = test_to_run);\n\n  wait for test completion by polling ifTestResult\n\n  when test completes, agent sets ifTestResult\n       agent also sets ifTestStatus = 'notInUse'\n\n  retrieve any additional test results, and ifTestId\n\n  if (ifTestId == lock_value+1) results are valid\n\nA manager station first retrieves the value of the\nappropriate ifTestId and ifTestStatus objects, periodically\nrepeating the retrieval if necessary, until the value of\nifTestStatus is 'notInUse'.  The manager station then tries\nto set the same ifTestId object to the value it just\nretrieved, the same ifTestStatus object to 'inUse', and the\ncorresponding ifTestOwner object to a value indicating\nitself.  If the set operation succeeds then the manager has\nobtained ownership of the ifTestEntry, and the value of the\nifTestId object is incremented by the agent (per the\nsemantics of TestAndIncr).  Failure of the set operation\nindicates that some other manager has obtained ownership of\nthe ifTestEntry.\n\nOnce ownership is obtained, any test parameters can be\nsetup, and then the test is initiated by setting ifTestType.\nOn completion of the test, the agent sets ifTestStatus to\n'notInUse'.  Once this occurs, the manager can retrieve the\nresults.  In the (rare) event that the invocation of tests\nby two network managers were to overlap, then there would be\na possibility that the first test's results might be\noverwritten by the second test's results prior to the first\n\nresults being read.  This unlikely circumstance can be\ndetected by a network manager retrieving ifTestId at the\nsame time as retrieving the test results, and ensuring that\nthe results are for the desired request.\n\nIf ifTestType is not set within an abnormally long period of\ntime after ownership is obtained, the agent should time-out\nthe manager, and reset the value of the ifTestStatus object\nback to 'notInUse'.  It is suggested that this time-out\nperiod be 5 minutes.\n\nIn general, a management station must not retransmit a\nrequest to invoke a test for which it does not receive a\nresponse; instead, it properly inspects an agent's MIB to\ndetermine if the invocation was successful.  Only if the\ninvocation was unsuccessful, is the invocation request\nretransmitted.\n\nSome tests may require the interface to be taken off-line in\norder to execute them, or may even require the agent to\nreboot after completion of the test.  In these\ncircumstances, communication with the management station\ninvoking the test may be lost until after completion of the\ntest.  An agent is not required to support such tests.\nHowever, if such tests are supported, then the agent should\nmake every effort to transmit a response to the request\nwhich invoked the test prior to losing communication.  When\nthe agent is restored to normal service, the results of the\ntest are properly made available in the appropriate objects.\nNote that this requires that the ifIndex value assigned to\nan interface must be unchanged even if the test causes a\nreboot.  An agent must reject any test for which it cannot,\nperhaps due to resource constraints, make available at least\nthe minimum amount of information after that test\ncompletes.")
