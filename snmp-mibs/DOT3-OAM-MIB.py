The functionality presented here is based on IEEE\n802.3ah [802.3ah], released in October, 2004.  [802.3ah] was\nprepared as an addendum to the standing version of IEEE 802.3\n[802.3-2002].  Since then, [802.3ah] has been\nmerged into the base IEEE 802.3 specification in [802.3-2005].\n\nIn particular, this MIB focuses on the new OAM functions\nintroduced in Clause 57 of [802.3ah].  The OAM functionality\nof Clause 57 is controlled by new management attributes\nintroduced in Clause 30 of [802.3ah].  The OAM functions are\nnot specific to any particular Ethernet physical layer, and\ncan be generically applied to any Ethernet interface of\n[802.3-2002].\n\nAn Ethernet OAM protocol data unit is a valid Ethernet frame\nwith a destination MAC address equal to the reserved MAC\naddress for Slow Protocols (See 43B of [802.3ah]), a\nlengthOrType field equal to the reserved type for Slow\nProtocols, and a Slow Protocols subtype equal to that of the\nsubtype reserved for Ethernet OAM.

Whether a peering\ndecision has been made is indicated via the local flags field\nin the OAMPDU (reflected in the aOAMLocalFlagsField of\n30.3.6.1.10).\n\nIf the remote OAM entity rejects the peering, the state\nbecomes oamPeeringRemotelyRejected(8).

This is indicated\nvia the remote flags field in the OAMPDU (reflected in the\naOAMRemoteFlagsField of 30.3.6.1.11).\n\nWhen the local OAM entity learns that both it and the remote\nOAM entity have accepted the peering, the state moves to\noperational(9) corresponding to the SEND_ANY state of the\nDiscovery state diagram [802.3ah, Figure 57-5].\n\nSince Ethernet OAM functions are not designed to work\ncompletely over half-duplex interfaces, the value\nnonOperHalfDuplex(10) is returned whenever Ethernet OAM is\nenabled (dot3OamAdminState is enabled(1)), but the interface\nis in half-duplex operation.")
